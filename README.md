# Turing Space Agency (formerly hobby-rocketry)

Welcome to the Turing Space Agency repository! This is where I detail all my endeavors with 3D printed rockets and the programs that control and/or read data from them. For more on my homemade flight computer, visit the [Project Skippy](https://github.com/olearyf/project-skippy) repo.

### Parts
 - [arcade button](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4187)
 - 9 volt battery
 - 220 ohm resistor (or whatever resistance you need for your LED)
 - 10k ohm resistor
 - 10 microfarad capacitor
 - pnp transistor
 - slide switch
 - electric igniters or nichrome wire
 - optional: breadboard for prototyping
 - optional: 3D printer for parts found [here](https://github.com/olearyf/turing-space-agency/tree/master/remote-ignition-system)
 
 ### Assembly
 
 Using the following schematic, test your circuit. From there, it is pretty quick and easy to wire up!
