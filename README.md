# Turing Space Agency (formerly hobby-rocketry)

Welcome to the Turing Space Agency repository! This is where I detail all my endeavors with 3D printed rockets and the programs that control and/or read data from them. For more on my homemade flight computer, visit the [Project Skippy](https://github.com/olearyf/project-skippy) repo.
